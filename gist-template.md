# Tutorial on the Email Validation Regex Pattern

This tutorial will teach you the Email Validation Regex Pattern. Regex stands for Regular Expressions, and is a great way to search and validate patterns in Text Data. The specific regex pattern that will be discussed in this tutorial is one that is used for validating email addresses.


## Summary

The regex pattern mentioned earlier is:

/^([a-zA-Z0-9_.+-])+@[a-zA-Z0-9-]+\.[a-zA-Z0-9-.]+$/

This pattern will let us know if an email is in the correct format. Lets dissect the pattern and take a closer look at each component listed below.

## Regex Components

### Anchors
These are the anchors:

(^ and $)

They are used to specify the beginning(^) and end($) of the string we want to match.
### Quantifiers
This is a Quantifier:

(+)

It is used to validate the username part of the email address
### OR Operator
This is a OR Operator:

(|)


### Character Classes
These are Character Classes:

([a-zA-Z0-9_.+-] 
used for Username

[a-zA-Z0-9-]  
used for Domain Name

[a-zA-Z0-9-.])
used for Top-Level Domain

They are enclosed in square brackets [] and define valid characters for specific parts of the email address
### Flags
Flags, represented by letters and enable things such as 

(g) global matching

(i) case-insensitive matching

(m) multiline matching

etc. 

which all modify the behavior of the regex pattern. In the email validation regex pattern, there are no flags specified. 
### Grouping and Capturing
Grouping is just the parentheses: 

() 

and it is for capturing specific parts of the email address for further validation or extraction.
### Bracket Expressions
Bracket expressions are the sqaure brackets:   

[]

and they define a set of characters that can be matched and also validates specific characters in the email address 
### Greedy and Lazy Match
Greedy and Lazy Match refer to the behavior of Quantifiers in matching patterns. In the Email Validation Regex Pattern, the (+) quantifier is used to match one or more occurrences of the preceding element. It is greedy by default, matching as many valid characters as possible. A Lazy Match is only used when the Quantifier needs to match as little occurances as possible
### Boundaries
This is a boundary:

(\b)

and it is used  to define word boundaries or specific positions within the regex pattern. This is not used in the Email Validation Regex Pattern, they can be applied to enforce constraints, such as matching email addresses only as standalone words.
### Back-references
These are Back Refrences

(\1) , (\2) , (\3) ,etc.

They allow us to refrence previously captured groups. This is also not used in this specific Regex Pattern, but they enable advanced validation and extraction scenarios where patterns need to be repeated or compared.
### Look-ahead and Look-behind
Look Ahead: 

(?=...)

Look Behind:

(?<=...)

They are zero-width assertions. They match a pattern only if it is followed or preceded by another pattern, respectively, without including the look-ahead or look-behind in the overall match result. Another technique not used in this specific example, but they can be utilized for additional constraints or contextual validations.
